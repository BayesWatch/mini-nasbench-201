# mini-nasbench-201
NAS-Bench-201 contains a lot of information and is therefore very big.

In my experience I rarely need access to **all** of the information to run an experiment, just a small subset (e.g. just the model accuracies)

This is a simple way to generate a small file which contains only the information you need. Either you can use the minibench file provided directly or you can generate your own with the info you want. 

On my machine, loading `minibench` took 0.0062 seconds, where NAS-Bench-201 took 61.0529 seconds.

## Example usage

First, copy the `minibench-arch-cell-accs.pd` file into your repository. 

```python
import pandas as pd

minibench = pd.read_pickle('minibench-arch-cell-accs.pd')

##Â get accuracy for arch 42 on cifar10-val
cifar10_val = minibench.iloc[42]['cifar10-val']
```

You can also `iloc` with a list of indices. The rows correspond to the `NAS-Bench-201` architecture IDs. 

The default column names are:
```
columns=['arch','cellstr','cifar10-test','cifar10-val', 'cifar100-test', 'cifar100-val', 'imagenet-test', 'imagenet-val']
```
